  * Average Revenue Per Paid User
  * Average Revenue Per User
#### 6. A certain metric is violating your expectations by going down or up more than you expect. How would you try to identify the cause of the change?
  * breakdown the KPI’s into what consists them and find where the change is
  * then further breakdown that basic KPI by channel, user cluster, etc. and relate them with any campaigns, changes in user behaviors in that segment
#### 7. Growth for total number of tweets sent has been slow this month. What data would you look at to determine the cause of the problem?
#### 8. You’re a restaurant and are approached by Groupon to run a deal. What data would you ask from them in order to determine whether or not to do the deal?
  * for similar restaurants (they should define similarity), average increase in revenue gain per coupon, average increase in customers per coupon
#### 9. You are tasked with improving the e ciency of a subway system. Where would you start?
  * define efficiency
#### 10. Say you are working on Facebook News Feed. What would be some metrics that you think are important? How would you make the news each person gets more relevant?

#### 12. You are on the data science team at Uber and you are asked to start thinking about surge pricing. What would be the objectives of such a product and how would you start looking into this?
  *  there is a gradual step-function type scaling mechanism until that imbalance of requests-to-drivers is alleviated and then vice versa as too many drivers come online enticed by the surge pricing structure. 
  * I would bet the algorithm is custom tailored and calibrated to each location as price elasticities almost certainly vary across different cities depending on a huge multitude of variables: income, distance/sprawl, traffic patterns, car ownership, etc. With the massive troves of user data that Uber probably has collected, they most likely have tweaked the algos for each city to adjust for these varying sensitivities to surge pricing. Throw in some machine learning and incredibly rich data and you've got yourself an incredible, constantly-evolving algorithm.
